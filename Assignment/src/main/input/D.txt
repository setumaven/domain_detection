Title: Shinkyos Shunkoden and discourse on Koreanness in Imperial Japan
Name: Moran KIM
Summary:
This essay aims to reinvent Shinkyos Shunkoden (Chunhyangjeon in Korean) directed by Murayama Tomoyoshi as a representation of Korean by Imperial Japan.
Shunkoden, passed {2.1} down mainly through oral tradition, is a Korean classic romance from the Joseon Dynasty.
Colonial Korea began to show great concern about its traditional culture in the 1930s, when Shunkoden was rediscovered as a Korean heritage of theatre, and revived on various stages including those by the intellectuals who engaged in the Shingeki (New Play) movement.
In 1936, a Korean Shingeki group put Shunkoden, adapted by Yu Chi-jin, on stage, and in 1937, a Korean student group also performed the same version in Tsukiji Syogekijyo, Tokyo.
Shinkyos Shunkoden, performed in both Japan and colonial Korea in 1938, can be regarded as one of those attempts to revive {2.1} Shunkoden as a Shingeki.
The important point is, however, that this performance by a Japanese theatre group was designed as a cultural manoeuvre to correspond to Imperial Japans new cultural policy since the Manchurian Incident.
In this sense, the production is clearly differentiated from two previous Korean versions, which were bred in the cultural nationalism of colonial Korea.
The essay attempts to define Shinkyos version as a form of representation of Korea and Koreans, in which the Korean audience curiously witnessed their mirror image as proposed by the Japanese.
There have been various studies on Shinkyos Shunkoden, but they have totally ignored the importance of the part played by the performance in the discursive space of Koreanness that could not help committing itself to the creation of the culture of Imperial Japan.
This paper will, therefore, reveal the mode of representation of Koreanness in Shinkyos production and examine the matter of how the Koreanness informed by Imperial Japan negotiated and competed with the Koreans own version of Koreanness.

Local Cultural Policy Debates in France: The Transition of Cultural Policies Values Between the Two FIC (19711994)
Yukiko NAGASHIMA
France, Local Cultural Policy, Regional Development, Decentralisation, Globalisation
This paper discusses the transition of central values in French local cultural policies by historical analysis of the national systems promoting the local governments cultural policies.
Fonds dIntervention Culturelle (FIC) established in 1971, once abolished in 1984, was revived in 1994 as Fonds dInnovation Culturelle (FIC).
The following trends can be noticed between these two dates.
1. Cultural Development is the central cultural policy value in the French 6th National Plan (197176).
Its purpose was to develop the personal potential of every citizen by improving the quality of every day life, including the cultural and artistic aspects.
The first FIC was established in this context.
Cultural Charters were also launched in 1974 in order to involve local governments and representatives in the planning of cultural policies.
2.
In the wave of decentralisation implemented by the socialist government and owing {2.1} to the expansion of the national cultural budget in the 1980s, the local governments and mayors emerged as the principal actors of local cultural policies by signing the Cultural Development Conventions with the ministry of culture.
From the mid 1980s, their cultural policies were often aimed at surviving the forthcoming inter-cities economic competition at the dawn of the creation of the European single market.
3.
In 1992, the notion of Cultural Town and Country Planning in French Territory emerged at the central government level in the context of economic globalisation and the establishment of the European Union.
This national policy indicated the existence of a geographic and social inequality of cultural opportunities for French citizens.
The role of culture for rebuilding social solidarity and in the fight against social exclusion was underlined in this discussion.
A partial revival of Cultural Development, the central value of the early 1970s, can be noticed in this movement.

Title/: An Arabic Trauerspiel
An Essay on Sulayman Al-Bassams Al-Hamlet Summit: A Political Arabesque
Name/: Mika Eglinton
Summary/:
Al-Hamlet Summit was written by British-Kuwaiti Sulayman Al-Bassam (1972~) in the context of todays global instability over the war on terrorism.
Driven by paradigm-shifting historical events, such as the attack of 9/11 and the US-led offensive on insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq, Al-Bassam developed a series of adaptations of Shakespeares Hamlet.
They are Hamlet in Kuwait in 2001, commissioned as part of the events of the tenth anniversary of Kuwaits liberation from Iraq; The Arab League Hamlet in 2002, performed at the Carthago Theatre Festival; the English version of Al-Hamlet Summit, which won awards at the Edinburgh International Fringe Festival and the Cairo International Festival of Experimental Theatre in 2002; and this Arabic language version of Al-Hamlet Summit with a pan-Arabic cast, co-produced in 2004 by the Tokyo Arts International Festival.
These adaptations of Shakespeares text, together with the background of world affairs, are intertwined as suggested in the subtitle: A Political Arabesque.
Al-Bassam presents the angle that the fates of Arabs and those of the West are contiguous; {2.1} the rising tides of Islamic fundamentalism and suicide bombers as desperate forms of resistance are caused by the geo-history of the Middle East, which is inextricably interwoven with that of the West. This Arabic Hamlet, with the role of Arms Dealer instead of the Ghost and Horatio, can be seen as the mirror image of Western prosperity built on Arabic resources.
Furthermore, it is possible to associate these texts and contexts with Walter Benjamins understanding of German Trauerspiels.
Quoting from his book Ursprung des deutschen Trauerspiels and other texts from the inter World War period, I intend to analyze the aspects of baroque allegories, tragic heroes, genius, destructive characters and fragments in Al-Hamlet Summit with a view to understanding the interplay between the Middle Eastern political situation and the stage.
